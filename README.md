# DLang

The **D**umbest **Lang**uage on Earth!

---------------------------------------

This is just a project I decided to take up. Nothin special.

---------------------------------------

## What it is:
DLang (Dumb Language) is a language that is currently under development and is basically SQL in JavaScript syntax! :D

Example:
```
import 'dl:main/base.dlang'
// Get's the print() function, which is not built in (since it is a database language)

print('Hello!')
//=> Hello!
```

---------------------------------------

## Ultimate Goal

Goal: Make a programming language with no installed dependencies (currently uses `fs` from `Node.JS`)!

Currently it is working!

## What I did/didn't do

What I did:
- `print()` function.
- default imports (`import 'dl:main/base.dlang'`)
- variables
- create database
- create document (`JSON` property)

What I need to do:
- update document/properties
- read document/properties
